# A Novel Framework for Combining Large and Small Language Models using Sparse Priming Representation and Recurrent Context Compression

This article outlines the research objectives for a project focused on developing a novel framework for combining large and small language models (LLMs) using Sparse Priming Representation (SPR) and Recurrent Context Compression (RCC) techniques. This framework aims to **optimise resource utilisation** and **enhance the performance** of LLMs for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially those involving long contexts.

## I. Introduction and Research Aim

**Broad Research Aim:** To develop a novel framework that leverages the strengths of large and small language models (LLMs) by combining Sparse Priming Representation (SPR) and Recurrent Context Compression (RCC) techniques, **optimising resource utilisation** and **enhancing performance** for various natural language processing tasks.

## II. Research Objectives

### A. SPR-RCC Framework Development

This objective focuses on the design and implementation of a robust framework that integrates SPR and RCC techniques into a multi-LLM pipeline. SPR involves using concise cues to activate specific regions of an LLM's latent space, where knowledge and abilities are embedded, enabling efficient and precise processing. RCC, on the other hand, is a method for extending the context window of LLMs by compressing long sequences of text into compact representations. By combining these techniques, the framework aims to overcome the limitations of single LLMs in handling long contexts and optimise resource utilisation.

The specific goals for framework development include:

1.  Design and implement a robust framework integrating SPR and RCC techniques into a multi-LLM pipeline within 6 months.
2.  Optimise Sparse Priming Representation (SPR):

    *   Determine optimal sparsity levels for various text lengths and complexities. This involves analysing the trade-off between conciseness and information retention for different types of text.
    *   Develop adaptive sparsity mechanisms based on input text structure. This could involve using techniques like entropy encoding to assign shorter codes to more frequent or informative elements in the text, similar to how Huffman coding  is used in data compression. Formally, given a text T with n unique elements ei, the entropy H(T) is calculated as:

        `H(T)=−∑i=1np(ei)log2p(ei)`

        where p(ei) is the probability of element ei appearing in the text. This entropy can be used to guide the selection of elements for the sparse priming representation, prioritising those with higher information content.
    *   Explore efficient encoding schemes like Huffman and arithmetic coding. These encoding schemes can be used to represent the sparse priming cues in a compact and efficient manner, minimising the number of tokens required. The Kraft-McMillan inequality  can be used to ensure that the encoding is both efficient and uniquely decodable. The Kraft-McMillan inequality states that for any uniquely decodable code with codeword lengths li, the following inequality holds:

        `∑i=1n2−li≤1`

        This inequality provides a mathematical guarantee that the chosen encoding scheme can be decoded without ambiguity, ensuring that the original information can be recovered from the compressed representation.
    *   Apply the Kraft-McMillan inequality to ensure efficient and self-delimiting SPR encoding. This inequality provides a mathematical guarantee that the chosen encoding scheme can be decoded without ambiguity, ensuring that the original information can be recovered from the compressed representation.
3.  Enhance Recurrent Context Compression (RCC):

    *   Implement iterative decoding algorithms with error correction. This involves developing algorithms that can iteratively refine the compressed representation of the context, correcting errors that may have been introduced during the compression process. Techniques inspired by low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes  can be used for this purpose. LDPC codes are known for their ability to achieve near-capacity performance on noisy channels, and their iterative decoding algorithms can be adapted to improve the accuracy of RCC.
    *   Develop contextual adaptation techniques using topic modelling and sentiment analysis. This involves incorporating information about the topic and sentiment of the text into the RCC process, allowing for more efficient and context-aware compression.
    *   Combine RCC with other compression techniques for higher compression ratios. This could involve exploring techniques like Lempel-Ziv compression or Burrows-Wheeler transform to further reduce the size of the compressed representation.
    *   Develop iterative decoding methods inspired by low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. These codes, known for their near-capacity performance and efficient decoding algorithms, can be adapted to refine the compressed context representation, correcting errors and maximizing information retention. One way to apply LDPC codes to RCC is to represent the compressed context as a codeword and use the LDPC decoding algorithm to iteratively refine this codeword, correcting any errors that may have occurred during the compression process. The LDPC decoding algorithm works by iteratively updating the probabilities of each bit in the codeword based on the parity-check constraints of the code. This iterative process can help to improve the accuracy of the compressed representation and recover the original context more effectively.
4.  Evaluate the framework's performance using compression ratio, semantic preservation, and computational efficiency metrics. This includes assessing the ability of the framework to maintain the meaning of the original text while reducing its size and the computational resources required for processing.

### B. Model Selection and Optimization

This objective focuses on developing a strategy for selecting the most effective large and small LLM models based on specific task requirements, resource limitations, and entropy-based metrics. Entropy, a measure of uncertainty or information content, can be used to assess the complexity and suitability of different LLMs for specific tasks. The goal is to identify optimal combinations of large and small LLMs that maximise performance while minimising resource consumption.

The specific goals for model selection and optimization include:

1.  Develop a strategy for selecting optimal large and small LLM models based on task requirements, resource constraints, and entropy-based metrics within 3 months.
2.  Evaluate and select model architectures:

    *   Compare performance of different LLM architectures with SPR and RCC. This involves evaluating how well different architectures, such as transformer-based models, can be integrated with the SPR and RCC techniques.
    *   Analyse trade-offs between model complexity and performance. Larger models with more parameters may have greater capacity but also require more computational resources. This analysis aims to find the optimal balance between model size and performance for different tasks and resource constraints.
3.  Optimise model parameters:

    *   Fine-tune hyperparameters for target tasks. This involves adjusting parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate to optimise the model's performance on specific tasks.
    *   Explore techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling. These techniques can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.
4.  Incorporate entropy minimisation in model selection, prioritising models that maximise information gain per token processed. This involves selecting models that can extract the most relevant information from the compressed representation, minimising uncertainty and maximising efficiency.
5.  Implement dynamic encoding for SPR, using adaptive encoding schemes weighted by information content. This involves assigning shorter codes to more informative elements in the text, based on their entropy or inverse probability weighting . This ensures that the most important information is conveyed with the fewest tokens, improving efficiency and reducing computational costs.
6.  Evaluate the impact of model selection on the framework's performance in terms of accuracy, latency, and cost-effectiveness. Different LLM combinations will be assessed based on their ability to accurately perform the task, the speed of response, and the associated computational costs.

### C. Prompt Engineering and Fine-tuning

This objective focuses on designing effective prompts for SPR, RCC, and LLM interactions, leveraging techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and instruction tuning. Prompt engineering involves crafting input prompts that guide the LLM towards generating desired outputs. Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the LLM to break down complex reasoning tasks into intermediate steps, improving performance and explainability. Instruction tuning involves fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset of instructions and desired outputs, enhancing its ability to follow instructions and perform specific tasks.

The specific goals for prompt engineering and fine-tuning include:

1.  Design effective prompts for SPR, RCC, and LLM interactions within 4 months, leveraging techniques like chain-of-thought prompting. This includes developing prompts that activate the relevant regions of the LLM's latent space for SPR, provide clear instructions for RCC compression and decompression, and guide the LLM towards generating coherent and relevant outputs. In order to simulate recurrent-depth processing in standard LLMs, we can leverage structured prompting techniques to guide the model through iterative refinement and reflection cycles. This can be achieved through prompt engineering strategies such as:

    *   State-Aware Iterative Refinement: Design prompts that explicitly instruct the LLM to maintain and update a "state" or context representation across multiple interaction cycles. This can be achieved by incorporating instructions like "Retain ALL key observations from previous cycles" and prompting the model to explicitly list key variables or concepts that are updated with each cycle.
    *   Compressed Reflection Protocol: Force the LLM to perform internal counterfactual analysis within a limited token budget by prompting it to consider different perspectives and potential contradictions before synthesising an answer. This can be achieved by structuring prompts with explicit sections for different viewpoints and their supporting evidence, along with potential risks or logical fallacies.
    *   Adaptive Computation Priming: Simulate per-token compute allocation by prompting the LLM to explicitly assign "reasoning units" to different steps of a problem-solving process based on their perceived difficulty. This can help guide the model to focus its computational resources on the most critical aspects of the task.
2.  Experiment with various prompt engineering techniques:

    *   Test few-shot, zero-shot, and in-context learning approaches. These approaches involve providing the LLM with a few examples, no examples, or examples within the prompt itself, respectively, to guide its behaviour.
    *   Develop methods to generate more creative and diverse outputs. This could involve using techniques like temperature scaling or top-k sampling to control the randomness of the LLM's output.
3.  Design fine-tuning strategies leveraging SPR and RCC:

    *   Explore knowledge distillation and transfer learning techniques. These techniques can be used to transfer knowledge from a larger, pre-trained LLM to a smaller LLM, improving efficiency and reducing resource requirements.
4.  Integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to break down complex tasks into subproblems, enhancing interpretability and efficiency. CoT prompting can be used to guide the LLM through a series of reasoning steps, making its decision-making process more transparent and potentially improving its performance on complex tasks.
5.  Implement prompt chaining to iteratively refine SPR and RCC outputs before passing them to smaller models. This involves using a series of prompts to progressively refine the compressed representation or the output of the smaller LLM, improving the overall quality and coherence of the generated text.
6.  Evaluate the impact of prompt engineering on the quality and coherence of generated outputs. Different prompt formats and strategies will be assessed based on their effect on the accuracy, fluency, and overall quality of the generated text.

### D. Evaluation and Benchmarking

This objective focuses on developing a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the performance of the proposed framework against state-of-the-art baselines. This involves comparing the framework's performance to existing methods for combining LLMs or using single LLMs on various NLP tasks.

The specific goals for evaluation and benchmarking include:

1.  Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework within 3 months to assess performance against state-of-the-art baselines. This involves defining clear evaluation metrics, selecting appropriate benchmarks, and establishing procedures for data collection and analysis.
2.  Conduct comprehensive evaluation:

    *   Assess performance on various NLP tasks. This includes evaluating the framework on tasks such as text summarisation, question answering, and machine translation.
    *   Use both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Quantitative metrics could include accuracy, BLEU score, and ROUGE score, while qualitative metrics could involve human evaluation of the generated text's fluency, coherence, and relevance.
3.  Benchmark against state-of-the-art methods:

    *   Compare with other LLM-based approaches and traditional NLP techniques. This involves comparing the framework's performance to existing methods for combining LLMs, as well as to traditional NLP techniques that do not use LLMs.
    *   Analyse computational efficiency and memory usage. This involves measuring the computational resources required by the framework and comparing them to the resources used by other methods.
4.  Evaluate the framework on standard benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE, as well as through human evaluation. GLUE and SuperGLUE are widely used benchmarks for evaluating language understanding capabilities. Human evaluation involves having human judges assess the quality and relevance of the generated outputs.
5.  Assess the impact of decompression guided by locality properties on output coherence and natural language flow. This involves evaluating how well the framework can preserve the relationships between words and phrases during the decompression process, ensuring that the generated text is coherent and natural.
6.  Identify strengths and weaknesses of the framework and inform future improvements. The evaluation results will be used to identify areas where the framework excels and areas where further improvements are needed, guiding future research and development efforts.

### E. Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI

This objective focuses on analysing the ethical implications of using large language models and addressing potential biases and misinformation. LLMs, due to their training on massive datasets, can reflect and amplify existing biases in the data. They can also be used to generate misleading or harmful content. This objective aims to ensure that the framework is developed and used responsibly, minimising potential negative impacts.

The specific goals for ethical considerations and responsible AI include:

1.  Analyse ethical implications and address potential biases and misinformation within 2 months.
2.  Develop bias mitigation techniques:

    *   Identify and mitigate bias in training data and decision-making. This involves analysing the training data for potential biases and developing techniques to mitigate these biases during the training process.
    *   Implement fairness constraints and regularisation techniques. These techniques can be used to encourage the model to make fair and unbiased predictions.
3.  Explore privacy-preserving methods:

    *   Investigate differential privacy and federated learning. These techniques can be used to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is used to train the LLMs.
    *   Ensure transparency and accountability in decision-making. This involves making the decision-making process of the LLMs more transparent and understandable, and establishing mechanisms for accountability when the LLMs make mistakes or produce harmful outputs.
4.  Assess societal impact:

    *   Consider potential effects on job displacement and misinformation. This involves analysing the potential impact of the framework on employment and the spread of misinformation.
    *   Develop guidelines for ethical use of LLMs and AI technologies. This involves developing guidelines for the responsible and ethical use of the framework and the LLMs it employs.
5.  Implement safeguards, including probabilistic rate limiting based on entropy estimates, to ensure responsible AI practices and API usage optimisation. This involves using entropy estimates of incoming queries to prioritise requests and limit API usage, ensuring responsible and efficient use of resources.
6.  Adhere to ethical guidelines and best practices for AI development. This includes following established guidelines, such as those provided by UNESCO and the EU, and engaging in ongoing discussions about ethical AI development.
7.  Promote the ethical use of AI and contribute to the development of responsible AI technologies. This involves raising awareness about ethical concerns, advocating for responsible AI practices, and contributing to the development of tools and techniques for mitigating risks.

### F. Additional Enhancements and Practical Adjustments

1.  Optimise the API simulation function to mimic real-world latency and error rates, improving robustness under practical constraints. This involves developing a more realistic API simulation that can accurately reflect the latency and error rates that may be encountered in real-world deployments.
2.  Implement rate limiting with probabilistic bounds based on entropy estimates of incoming queries, ensuring compliance with API usage while prioritising high-entropy requests for detailed processing. This involves using entropy estimates to dynamically adjust rate limits, ensuring that the system can handle a variety of requests while staying within API usage limits.
3.  During decompression, preserve locality properties (e.g., dependency proximity) to ensure coherence and natural language flow, leveraging constraints from incremental language processing. This involves developing decompression techniques that can maintain the relationships between words and phrases in the text, ensuring that the generated text is coherent and natural.
